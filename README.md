## 1. Introduction  
Globally, nearly one-third of produced food is wasted before it reaches consumers.  
Restaurants, hotels, catering companies, corporate cafeterias, and supermarkets often throw away surplus food at the end of the day.  

**FOOD BRIDGE** is a mobile/web platform designed to reduce food waste and support small businesses by heavily leveraging **data science techniques**.  

**Core principles:**  
- Businesses list surplus food items at the end of the day.  
- The app applies **real-time dynamic pricing** or redirects items for **donation**.  
- Users can purchase products or donate them directly to NGOs.  
- The system analyzes user behavior, purchase trends, and donation habits, then provides geo-based recommendations and optimizes logistics.  
- CRM and RFM analyses enable customer segmentation and personalized campaigns.  

---

## 2. Core Features  

- **Real-Time Pricing**  
  - Automatic price drops as closing time approaches.  
  - Techniques: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Reinforcement Learning (planned).  

- **Predictive Recommendations**  
  - Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Neural Collaborative Filtering.  

- **Donation Option**  
  - NGO API integration, donation trend analysis, CRM-based segmentation.  

- **Neighborhood Support**  
  - GeoPandas, Folium for regional analysis.  

- **Corporate Participation**  
  - Dashboards with RFM-based performance measurement.  

- **Categorized Packages**  
  - NLP-based text analysis, category filtering.  

- **Return/Cancellation Policies**  
  - User behavior analysis, credit systems.  

---

## 3. CRM & RFM Analytics  

- **Data Collected for CRM:**  
  - Purchased packages (product, price, date)  
  - Donation frequency  
  - Average basket value  
  - Location-based behavior  

- **RFM Segments & Strategies:**  
  - **Champion**: Frequent buyers, high spend â†’ Exclusive discounts, priority alerts  
  - **At Risk**: Havenâ€™t purchased in a long time â†’ Reminder emails, bonus points  
  - **Potential Loyalist**: New but frequent buyers â†’ Loyalty program suggestions  

- **Predictive Models:**  
  - CLV (Customer Lifetime Value): Gradient Boosting, Random Forest  
  - Churn Prediction: Logistic Regression, XGBoost
